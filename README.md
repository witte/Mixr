# Mixr
Qt based mixer for the Jack audio server.

Just a little project that I'm using to learn C++, the Qt framework and QML. The main goal is to take the features that I like the most from the current 'patchbay' apps - QJackCtl, Carla/Claudia/Catia, Patchage - and put them all in a single (and hopefully cross-platform) application with a QML gui.

Pretty much useless at the moment.

Requirements:
  - Qt Framework (http://qt.io/)
  - JACK Audio Connection Kit (http://jackaudio.org/)
  - JACK development libraries (libjack-jackd2-dev on Ubuntu)
